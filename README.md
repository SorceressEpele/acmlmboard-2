# Acmlmboard II
In this repository you will find the code for Acmlmboard II. This is the version that was forked off for use at Kafuka. Acmlmboard II is the second in a series of web forum software systems originally designed and coded by Acmlm. Over the years it has since been added to and maintained by passionate users and developers.

This software is as-is and has no guarantees.

Branches

**develop** - This is the main branch. It is the most up to date and usually stable. Since this is also the development branch it is recommended you test before using on live.

**stable** - This is the branch is a snapshot of develop where most things are working and should install and run without any major issues.

**experimental** - This branch was started be xenons and includes the start of fundamental improvements for the board. If you fork the board I would recommend starting here and building on it.

Please feel free to fork this and improve on it!
# Installing Acmlmboard II
This document will guide you in the process to installed ABII.

Requirements
------------
These requirements are based on our development environment's specifications. While older versions may work since the code is mostly wrote for 2005, our new components take advantage of more modern functioning. It is recommended you use the requirements provided for best results.

- Apache httpd ver >= 2.2.21 (Should work on earlier versions)
- MySQL5+/MariaSQL
- PHP v5.7+ (old versions may work, but are unsupported. **Note:** PHP 7 support is currently *experimental* )
- PHP-GD
- mcrypt and the module for PHP
- phpmyadmin or DB tool of your choice.

Installation
############
1. Clone the git repository. Make sure you are on **develop** (or download the tarball and extract it)
2. If you haven't done so make a MySQL DB and create a MySQL user for the board to use. It is **required** you provide this use CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE privilege or the tag generator will not work.
3. change to the public_html dir. You may need to change the permissions to allow your httpd to read the board. It is recommended to change the owner and group to your httpd's user account/group. Make sure that themes_serial.txt is writable by the server. This file is the cache used for the theme system. Make sure the directories ./userpics and gfx/tags are present and are writable by the httpd as well. 
4. Using mysql (or phpmyadmin) you will need to load the schema + basic data (sql/main.sql) into your database. (mysql -u **dbuser** -p **database** < main.sql). 
5. If there are any optional features you wish to use (sprites, shop/items, more ranks, ip location, and more [See "Optional Databases"] you may load them now the same way you loading the main database.
6. In the public_html/lib/ dir you will find the location of the board configuration. copy or rename **config.sample.php** to **config.php**. Edit it in your favorite editor. See **Configuring ABII** for more details
7. Open up the board in your browser. Register your first user. In the future this user will automatically become **Root Administrator** via an interactive installer. 
8. Open up phpmyadmin (or other mysql tool) and open up the user table. Change your login's group_id to 6 and power to 4. This will make your account a member of the Root Admin group (6) and the legacy power level to 4 (root).
9. Use the Manage Forums link at the top to make come catagories and some forums.
10. The Permissions system, hidden forums, and other actions will have to be manually set in the database. Please see **Managing Permissions Manually**
